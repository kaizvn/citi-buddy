# Requirement

  Implement a simple application which organizes data for a city. It should store data for the cityâ€™s water supply, electricity and waste. All three need to be tracked with own attributes (which you can define creatively in a way it makes sense to you). 

At least one of the data streams should come in through integration, one should be uploaded and one should be entered manually. The user should be able to analyze the data on some UI. All implemented features should be covered by automated tests.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
# pull modules
yarn

# generate db and seed data
yarn prisma:generate
yarn prisma:seed 

#  run dev
