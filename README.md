## Requirement

  Implement a simple application which organizes data for a city. It should store data for the cityâ€™s water supply, electricity and waste. All three need to be tracked with own attributes (which you can define creatively in a way it makes sense to you). 

At least one of the data streams should come in through integration, one should be uploaded and one should be entered manually. The user should be able to analyze the data on some UI. All implemented features should be covered by automated tests.


## Documentation
  I write down an [IMPLEMENTATION NOTE](/documentation/IMPLEMENTATION.md) to let you know about my approach, ideas and expected results.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started



Create `.env` file to connect dumb sqlite db 
```
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

Run command to start in local 
```bash
# pull modules
yarn

# generate db and seed data
yarn prisma:generate
yarn prisma:push
yarn prisma:seed 

#  run dev
yarn dev

# build & start production
yarn build
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

** Note: Because Vercel's infra does not support SQLite yet, so please setup an db and update DATABASE_URL in `.env` 

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
